		This file demonstrates how to use a shared configuration file. In this
		case the absolute path of the file is /shared/config.js. Shared 
		configuration can be used to ensure:
		a) A version of the applications configuration is bundled with the app  
		   at build time - i.e. the locally included config.js file
		b) The latest version of the applications configuration can be loaded 
		   using a cloud action call<br/>

		To fully appreciate local vs cloud config: build this app and install it on a 
		device. Once installed, change the contents of the config variable in config.js 
		from within the Studio and click the button to "Execute cloud action call" in 
		the app on the device. 
		Notice how the config returned from the cloud action call reflects the changes 
		just made, while the local config remain static. Using this method, you can keep 
		your apps updated with new configuration information without the need to publish  
		a new app to the app store.
